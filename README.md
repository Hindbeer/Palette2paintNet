# Palette2paintNet
Palette2paintNet - This program is for creating a palette from a photograph (or a ready-made palette in photo format) for paint.net.After creating the palette, you are given a txt file with the main colors in the photo, which can be used in paint.net
## For installation
To work you need [Python3](https://www.python.org), the `colorthief` and `pillow` library to work first
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
For better performance, create a separate virtual environment
## How to use
The main file is `main.py` 

![main](img/main.png)

After launch, you will be asked to enter the path to the desired image from which you want to make a palette, and then the number of colors in this palette (from 0 to infinity)
